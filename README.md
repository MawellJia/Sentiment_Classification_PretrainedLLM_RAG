## Introduction
This is one of my assignments during my university education. This assignment aims for us to practice pre-trained large language models and inquiry systems. There are three questions for this assignment, 
and I have answered all the questions and got a high score. But I didn't get a satisfactory result on Kaggle, there is still much more improvement if you adjust some parameters. I want to appreciate my teacher's
efforts here, I can't learn so many things without you, thank you. I uploaded this assignment mainly for my self-review so that I won't forget this knowledge. And it will be great if this assignment can help
more people.

The three questions are mainly about:
1. IMDb movie review sentiment classification: It is required to use a transformer-based model (such as BERT) to classify the sentiment of IMDb movie reviews into positive or negative.
   
2. Text type classification: Participate in a Kaggle competition where the goal is to classify text into the correct type based on its content.

3. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system implementation: Compare the performance of standard information retrieval systems and direct query pre-trained large language models (LLM),
   implement a RAG system, and explore the possibility of utilizing LLMs in information retrieval.
